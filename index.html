    <details>
        <summary>What is HTML?</summary><ul><li>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It's the standard language used to create web pages. It defines the structure and content of a webpage, including text, images, links, and other elements.</li></ul></details>
    <details><summary>Why do we use HTML?</summary><ul><li>HTML is essential for building web pages because it provides the framework for organizing and displaying content. It allows you to structure text, add images and media, create links, and define the layout of your webpage.</li></ul></details>
    <details><summary>What is doctype in HTML?</summary><ul><li>The doctype declaration specifies the document type definition (DTD) of an HTML document. It tells the web browser which version of HTML is being used. For example,  &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; indicates that the document is using HTML5.</li></ul></details>
    <details><summary>What is the root element of HTML?</summary><ul><li>The root element of HTML is &lt;html&gt;. It encompasses all other elements in an HTML document.</li></ul></details>
    <details><summary>What is a tag?</summary><ul><li>A tag is a keyword surrounded by angle brackets (< >) that defines an element in HTML. It specifies the start and end of an element. For example, &lt;p&gt; and &lt;/p&gt; are tags that define a paragraph.</li></ul></details>

    <details><summary>Give me a few examples of self-closing tags?</summary><ul><li>Self-closing tags are tags that don't require a closing tag. They are often used for elements that don't contain content, such as images and line breaks. Here are a few examples:

        &lt;img&gt; (image) <br>
        &lt;br&gt; (line break) <br>
        &lt;hr&gt; (horizontal rule) <br>
        &lt;input&gt; (input field) <br>
        &lt;meta&gt; (metadata)</li></ul></details>
    <details><summary>What is an element?</summary><ul><li>An element is a unit of content in an HTML document, defined by a pair of opening and closing tags. Elements can contain text, other elements, or attributes. <br>For example, &lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph.&lt;/p&gt; is an element.</li></ul></details>
    <details><summary>How many types of elements are there in HTML?</summary><ul><li>There are many types of elements in HTML, each serving a specific purpose. Some common types include:

        Block elements: &lt;div&gt;, &lt;header&gt;, &lt;footer&gt;, &lt;section&gt;, etc. <br>
        Inline elements: &lt;a&gt;, &lt;img&gt;, &lt;span&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;, etc. <br>

For example, &lt;article&gt; indicates an article, &lt;nav&gt; indicates navigation, and &lt;header&gt; indicates a header. </li><br>
        <li>Non-semantic elements: These elements do not have any inherent meaning. They are used primarily for styling and layout purposes. For example, &lt;div&gt; and &lt;span&gt; are non-semantic elements.</li></ul></details>
